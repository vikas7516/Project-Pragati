# ABOUT 

We welcome you to participate in the Online Hackathon on data-driven innovation for Aadhaar, organised by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in association with National Informatics Centre (NIC), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

UIDAI has made anonymised datasets of Aadhaar enrolment and updates, available to the participating teams to identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, or predictive indicators and translate them into clear insights or solution frameworks that can support informed decision-making and system improvements.


# PROBLEM STATMENT

**Problem Statement: Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates**

Identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, or predictive indicators and translate them into clear insights or solution frameworks that can support informed decision-making and system improvements.


# SUBMISSION AND EXPECTATION

Participants must submit one consolidated PDF containing the following sections:

- **Problem Statement and Approach:** A concise description of the problem being addressed and the proposed analytical or technical approach.  
- **Datasets Used:** A clear description of the dataset(s) and columns used for the analysis. Participants must use the Aadhaar enrolment and/or update dataset provided by UIDAI.  
- **Methodology:** A detailed explanation of the methodology adopted, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and any transformations applied before analysis.  
- **Data Analysis and Visualisation:** A description of key findings and insights, and the visualisations or infographics developed. Participants must also include code files or notebooks used for the analysis (in the PDF itself).
